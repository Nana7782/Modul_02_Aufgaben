# Welcome to my excercises Repository for Module 02 of WebDev Bootcamp

Here you can find all the exercises I do to learn typescript.

As you can't see the actual tasks I'm working on, this will not make a lot of sense, but if you want to give it a look anyways, there are some things you need to do and need to use:

### Clone the repository & open with VSCode

![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)

```bash
gh repo clone Nana7782/Modul_02_Aufgaben
```

### navigate to the subfolder

```bash
cd ts_exercises
```

### run dev tools and open console in your browser

```bash
npm run dev
```

- this is necessary, as most excercises (at least in the beginning) wil use console.log() for output

### Have fun xD
